# Recipe Search

This is a simple recipe search app that utilizes the Edamam API. You will need to set up your own API keys in `services/environment.js`.

## Get Started
After setting up your API key under `services/environment.js`, run `npm install` then `npm start`.

## Noteworthy
This utilizes the class structure from ES2015. It splits each aspect into a controller, component, and module. 

## Layout
```
/app
  /modules
    /favorites
    /search
    /shared
  /services
```

## Testing
Tests have not been implemented.
